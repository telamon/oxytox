# Heroes of Oxytonia

### Hello there brave adventurer and welcome to the Guild!

**HoX** is an experimental social meta-game to combat
`stress`, `exhaustion` and `depression`.
We've crafted it with love and care so that it can be enjoyed by everybody,
even those of us that lost their torch and are wandering the **Dungeons of Despair**.

> No app nor installation needed, but a smartphone with a camera is a good first step.

**Don't worry** and most importantly **Have Fun!**
