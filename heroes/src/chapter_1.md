# Heroes of Oxytonia

### Hello there brave adventurer and welcome to the Guild!

**HoX** is an experimental social meta-game to combat
`stress`, `exhaustion` and `depression`.
We've crafted it with love and care so that it can be enjoyed by everybody,
even those of us that lost their torch and are wandering in the dark.

> No app nor installation needed, but a smartphone with a camera is a good to have.

**Don't worry** and most importantly **Have Fun!**

## Introduction

We all know that it's dangerous to go alone so you got to recruit
a party and prepare yourselves to raid the **Dungeons of Despair**
where the mythical sword **Twister of Destiny** is said to be buried.

Take a look at the quest board and pick anyone you like.

## Quest Board

As a beginner you're entitled to the `E` difficulty quests.
