# Summon your Minion Lv1

## Tutorial stage (Offline Ritual of Dominion)

Let's all just agree that if you
really really really think about it, then cameras are helluva scary.
If you disagree then you can safely skip this tutorial.
(Recommendation: Use opencamera or turn off photo cloud-sync
to keep your recordings private.)

01. Imagine your selfie-camera as a somewhat scary demon.
02. Accept that it is your demon. (Gain ownership)
03. `sudo` Rename your demon to minion (or some other silly name)
04. As an overlord face your minion for 30 seconds. (without recording)
05. Then record 1s in silence without replaying it.
06. Goto homescreen and try to forget this ever happend.
07. (Next day) Face your minion and say "Hello Minion" then hang up. (again don't replay, try to forget)
08. (Day after next) Greet your minion it should be fearing you now
09. Repeat steps 5, 7 and 8 if necessary, until the minion has shrunk to manageable size and is mute in awe of your precense.
10. delete/encrypt all recordings except the last.
11. Replay last recording.
12. Try to hang out with your minion at least 1 second a day, otherwise it get's lonely.

Congratulations you have completed the tutorial!
