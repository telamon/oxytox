**Release note**
```
Hello World!
We have a somewhat early üéÅ for you.
It's an experimental social game that lets you send
real hugs to friends and family over the internet.‚ú®
But in truth it's a tiny puzzle, can you solve it? ü§ì
Challenge someone you're comfortable with
or just pm an oxytox to someone who could use it.
After response, did you feel the "hugsies"? If yes, then why?

Merry Christmas! /DecentLabs üéÖ

> Artificial hugs for everyone

In our nonrelenting fight against long term depression,
we propose to inject a decentralized hug virus into the meme-stream.

**Expected outcome:**
- stimulate social function
- maintain relations
- induce mutual oxytocin release
- mitigate negative effects of social distancing

## Play
Start a new game by sharing the image below to a friend via some sort of private message (telegram/discord/fbmessgener/...)
and either ask them "Wanna play?" or if you're brave go ahead and send them your silent greeting directly.
(Just don't forget to send the rules/image first or things will get real awkward real fast)

### Additional guidelines/observations

- First time players should pick someone they've shared a hug with IRL.
- no words! (Words can hurt while faces seldom lie and so on.. wordless humming is fine! :>).
- avoid retakes, try to send before watching it yourself.
- don't reuse recordings, each is personal and unique.
- don't forward personal recordings either, it's not nice. 
- If you don't get a reply dont despair, Receiving a hug can sometimes take more courage than giving one. Send another to someone else! üëç
- The feeling of awkwardness increases with higher durations, but so does the social stimuli.
- 1 hug a day keeps sighs at bay.
- tested with discord & telegram üëå

If you're reading this it means that the docs are missing or in a bad state.

Writing and maintaining friendly and useful documentation takes
effort and time. In order to do faster releases
I will from now on provide documentation relational to project activity.
