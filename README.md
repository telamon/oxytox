> Artificial hugs for everyone

In our nonrelenting fight against long term depression,
we propose to inject a decentralized hug virus into the meme-stream.

**Expected outcome:**
- stimulate social function
- maintain relations
- induce mutual oxytocin release
- mitigate negative effects of social distancing

## Play
Start a new game by sharing the image below to a friend via some sort of private message (telegram/discord/fbmessgener/...)
and either ask them "Wanna play?" or if you're brave go ahead and send them your silent greeting directly.
(Just don't forget to send the rules/image first or things will get real awkward real fast)

### Additional guidelines/observations
[Feedback &amp; rule suggestions are welcome](https://github.com/telamon/oxytox/issues/new)

- First time players should pick someone they've shared a hug with IRL.
- no words! (Words can hurt while faces seldom lie and so on.. wordless humming is fine! :>).
- avoid retakes, try to send before watching it yourself.
- don't reuse recordings, each is personal and unique.
- don't forward personal recordings either, it's not nice. 
- don't be dissapointed if you don't get a reply. Giving a hug is half the effort.
- The feeling of awkwardness increases with higher durations, but so does the social stimuli.
- tested with discord & telegram ðŸ‘Œ

If you're reading this it means that the docs are missing or in a bad state.

Writing and maintaining friendly and useful documentation takes
effort and time. In order to do faster releases
I will from now on provide documentation relational to project activity.
